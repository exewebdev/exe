                            The resume is your most important job search tool. Your resume should effectively summarize
                            your education, experiences, and accomplishments in a way that demonstrates your
                            qualifications for the type of position you are seeking.  Your resume may have a variety of
                            sections, but should include the following sections: <i> Objective, Summary of
                            Qualifications, Education, Work, Experience and Activities.</i><br />
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In developing a resume you are encouraged to:<br/>
                            - Pay careful attention to spelling, grammar, punctuation, and writing style.<br />
                            - Organize information in a logical fashion.<br />
                            - Keep descriptions clear and to the point.<br />
                            - Limit to one page if possible.<br />
                            - Use a simple,easy to use font.<br /><br />
                            use a good, high quality, 100% bond paper taht is white or off-white.  Do no print on both
                            sides of the page.  Include your references on a separate page. Remember, your resume is
                            your introduction to who you are and what skills you can offer an employer!

                            A resume is a professional reflection of you as a potential employee.  The goal is to
                            showcase confidence in your ability to fulfill the qualifications of the position for which
                            you are applying.  Follow these eight steps to create a more effective resume.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Step 1: Getting Started</h4>
                        <p>
                            <strong>How do you get started?</strong> You should begin your resume with a heading that
                            includes your name, address, phone number and email address.  You may want to include a
                            permanent address and alternate contact information. Be sure to include a zip code and
                            telephone area codes.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>What is your objective?</strong> Prepare a brief, clear statement stating the type
                            of work you are seeking, the field in which you are interested, and the skills and strengths
                            you bring to the organization.

                            Always get a second opinion on your resume.  You know your intentions, but your wording
                            might not be clear.

                            A second opinion can help you correct mistakes before a potential employer does. Second
                            opinions can come from a 24-hour critique or 48-hour online critique at Career Services or
                            from a personal appointment with a Career Counselor. A friend, advisor, employer, or
                            professor, can also offer comments on your resume.
